HERE WE USE THE PYTHON CODE FOR THE DIGITAL WALLET MARKETING
INTRODUCTION:
Welcome to the Digital Wallet Marketing for Beginners guide! This document is designed to help you understand the basics of digital wallet marketing in a simple and straightforward way. Whether you're new to digital wallets or just want to learn how to market them effectively, this guide will give you the knowledge you need to get started.

What is a Digital Wallet?
A digital wallet, also known as an e-wallet, is an electronic version of a physical wallet that allows users to store and manage their money online. With a digital wallet, users can:
Make Payments: Pay for goods and services online or in-store without needing cash or a physical card.
Store Information: Keep track of payment methods, like credit and debit cards, in one place.
Transfer Money: Send and receive money easily between friends, family, or businesses.

Conclusion

Marketing a digital wallet successfully requires understanding your audience, highlighting the benefits of your service, and communicating in a clear and engaging way. By focusing on what matters most to your users—security, convenience, and ease of use—you can create a compelling message that encourages more people to choose your digital wallet.
Libraries and Modules Used
This Python script is a standalone program that simulates a basic digital wallet system, processing user balances and transactions. The script primarily relies on Python's built-in modules, so no additional third-party libraries are required to run it. Below is a list of the built-in modules and their purpose in the code:

1. built-in functions
input(): Used to simulate user input for the program. In the provided code, input() is overridden to read from a pre-defined list (input_data), which mimics the process of reading from standard input.
print(): Used to output the results of the transactions and the final sorted list of user balances.
2. built-in data structures
dict: A dictionary (user_balances) is used to store user IDs and their corresponding balances. This allows for efficient retrieval and update of balances as transactions are processed.
list: A list (transaction_results) is used to store the result ("Success" or "Failure") of each transaction, which is later printed out.
3. built-in functions and constructs for processing
map(): Used to convert input strings to integers for processing user IDs and balances, as well as transaction amounts.
sorted(): Used to sort the dictionary of user balances by balance amount in ascending order for the final output.
4. iter() and next()
These are used to simulate the input() function by iterating over a predefined list of inputs, which helps in testing the script with sample data without manual input.
5. lambda
lambda x: x[1]: A small anonymous function used in sorting the dictionary of user balances based on the balance amount.
